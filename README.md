I used Python to create front-end and back-end of book store website and SQLITE for storing data.
To run the program, it needs to install some packages in "requirements.txt".
If use Pycharm IDE, automatically ask you to install packages in requirements.txt file. 
Or you can install these packages using command line:
open terminal window and run this command:
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
